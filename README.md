## Object Detection Using Turtlebot 3 Burger
The overall goal of the project is to detect an object using turtlebot 3 burger. From an implementation perspective, this project deals with Robot Operating System (ROS) and OpenCV (Open-source Computer Vision Library).

OpenCV methods are used for detecting the object and ROS is used for linking perception stage to actuation stage. (The detection script and nodes are implemented in Python)

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to use the TurtleBot 3 Burger robot for object detection. The TurtleBot 3 Burger is a small and affordable robot equipped with various sensors, including a camera, and lidar sensors that allows us to detect objects in its environment.

In this project, we use the ROS (Robot Operating System) framework along with the OpenCV library to perform real-time object detection. The TurtleBot 3 Burger captures images using its camera and processes them to identify objects of interest.

## Installation
To use this project, follow these steps:

Install ROS on your computer. You can refer to the official ROS documentation for installation instructions.

Set up the workspace for the TurtleBot 3 Burger. You can follow the TurtleBot 3 Burger documentation to set up the necessary ROS packages and configurations.

Clone this repository into your ROS workspace:
```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
$ cd ..
$ catkin_make
```

(Add dependencies. You can find the list of dependencies in the project's package.xml file.

Download the pre-trained object detection model weights. Depending on your requirements, you can choose a suitable model such as YOLO, SSD, or Faster R-CNN. Store the downloaded weights in the appropriate location within the project directory.)

## Usage
To run the object detection using TurtleBot 3 Burger, follow these steps:

Connect the TurtleBot 3 Burger to your computer.

Launch the necessary ROS nodes for TurtleBot 3 Burger:
```
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_robot.launch
```
Launch the object detection node:

```
$ roslaunch object_detection detection.launch
```

The TurtleBot 3 Burger will start capturing images and performing object detection in real-time. The detected objects will be displayed on the screen or published as ROS topics, depending on the implementation.

## Features
* Real-time object detection using the TurtleBot 3 Burger robot and a camera.
* Support for various object detection models.
* ROS integration for seamless communication and control.
